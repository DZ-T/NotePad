### Simple Notepad

**Welcome to Simple Notepad**, a straightforward Notepad application that I created primarily for learning purposes. It's basic, it's a bit silly, but it's a starting point for me to dive into software development and explore how to build useful tools.
### Features
- **Basic Text Editing**: Write, edit, and save text files.
- **Open and Save Files**: Simple functionality to handle text files.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Focus on functionality with a basic user interface.
- **Word Wrap**
- **Change Background color**
- **Change text color**
- **Prompt the user to save before creating/opening a new file**

### Future Plans

I intend to develop this Notepad further, adding more features and functionalities along the way. Stay tuned for updates as I learn and grow in my coding journey!
- **Fix Find & Replace Functionality:** I copied and pasted and delete ... millions of lines but it doesn't work :(
- **Code Refactoring:** Improve code structure and readability.
- **UI Enhancement:** Update the user interface for improved aesthetics and usability.Do you remember the console app and MS-DOS? They have better UIs than this project, TBH. 
- **Language Localization:** Implement multi-language support, exploring modern file formats for localization.I tried to create .resx files for Arabic,English & French but i feel like it's an old way what about creating like .inf file for each language ?
- **Line Numbering:** Add the ability to display line numbers for better navigation in text files.
- **Plugins ?** who knows
